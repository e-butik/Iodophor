# Iodophor
A PHP library for binary IO and bit twiddling.

Huge credits goes out to Sven Vollbehr for his library [php-reader](http://code.google.com/p/php-reader/). As of right now, this is basically just his code in some new namespaced classes (for PSR-0 compatibility) and a Composer file with a new (and pretty awesome) name.

If you want to be able to read or write media file information in an object-oriented fashion you should definitly check php-reader out.

Calling this a fork would be a misnomer. We prefer to think of it as a remix, with full credits, of course.
